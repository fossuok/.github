Welcome to the **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Community** at the University of Kelaniya-a student-led group passionate about open-source technologies, collaboration, and innovation. Whether you're a beginner exploring Linux or an experienced developer contributing to global projects, our community is here to support your growth. Think of us as your reliable co-pilot in the open-source skies.

## About Us

We are a dynamic community of University of Kelaniya undergraduates dedicated to promoting the adoption of FOSS, fostering hands-on learning, and contributing to the open-source ecosystem. Established to empower students with practical skills and real-world experience, we host workshops, mentorship programs, and collaborative initiatives that bridge academia and industry.

Our focus is on creating an inclusive space where ideas are shared freely, skills are built collectively, and impact is made together-because the best code, like the best ideas, thrives in good company.

## Our Mission

- **Educate and Empower**: Provide accessible learning opportunities in open-source tools, programming, and technologies like Linux and beyond, turning "I wonder" into "I can."
- **Collaborate and Contribute**: Encourage participation in real-world projects, from code contributions to documentation and community building-small steps that lead to big ripples.
- **Build Connections**: Network with peers, mentors, and industry experts to inspire innovation and career growth, proving that two heads (and a few keyboards) are better than one.

## Recent Highlights

- **Third Annual General Meeting (September 2025)**: Celebrated community milestones and introduced our new board of officers, complete with insightful discussions over virtual coffee.
- **Advanced Linux Program (July–November 2025)**: A selection-based, 4-month hands-on course mentored by Nuwan Kaushalya (Lead Engineer at Persistent Systems), covering basics to RHCSA-level mastery-graduates emerged ready to command the terminal like pros.
- **Ongoing Membership Drive**: Open registrations for new members-join to access exclusive workshops, events, and resources, and maybe even snag a spot in our next hackathon.
